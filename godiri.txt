Godiri International Limited, founded in 2014; has a team of professionals with extensive experience in small to large complex projects.

Our project delivery is remarkable due to strong leadership from our engineering team getting involved at the early stages of the project to identify the project risks.

This allows the design to be procured and delivered to exacting standards. Our objective is to provide our clients with an “I am assured” experience when we are chosen to execute their projects. Our emphasis on clear communication and follow-through procedures ensures that client’s objectives are top priority in the planning and execution of all our processes.

Our project management and execution philosophy is:
 Create detail schedule and resources plan to meet client’s project objective,
 Communicate clearly with all project stakeholders,
 Track project progress and fine-tune deviations,
 Supervise closely on quality of work done,
 Complete and commission the project on time.
We take pride in our delivery, thus our clients can always be assured that only the most experienced and qualified people are serving them, all the time.
